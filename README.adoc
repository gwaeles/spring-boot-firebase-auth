= Spring Boot Backend secured with Firebase in Kotlin

== The story

I was working on a mobile application and I needed to make a lightweight backend to provide some functionality and store data.

I wanted a quick solution, so I chose a technology I've already used: Spring Boot, but I wanted to follow best practices as much as possible.

The first issue that was essential was authentication and security. I'm not an expert in this domain but like all developers I know that the pattern that is the reference is the Oauth2. Moreover, from a user experience point of view, I find it very nice to log in with your Google account. It's kind of the "all-inclusive" solution.

So I chose Firebase to entrust the mission of authenticating my users. It does the job and I am serene about security and evolutivity.
It was also an opportunity to play with Firebase Cloud Firestore to store data.

On this repo, I made the bases of a backend with the following elements:

* link:https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/web-reactive.html[Spring Webflux]
* link:https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/admin/verify-id-tokens[Firebase Admin]
* link:https://spring.io/projects/spring-cloud-gcp[Spring Cloud GCP]
* link:https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-static/spring-cloud-gcp/1.2.0.RC1/reference/html/#spring-data-reactive-repositories-for-cloud-firestore[Spring Data Cloud Firestore]

== Content of project
The goal is to provide a route to validate a user authenticated on a mobile application.
I added the notion of member, a model stored in a database that will allow me to easily manage the role of each user and later possibly other information.

So I'm going to create the following entry point :

----
GET /me
----

The client app have to put the grant type and the bearer token in the headers.
So the backend will proceed of the validation of the authentication and return the corresponding member object.

----
{
    "tokenUid": "--Unique--ID--",
    "name": "John Doe",
    "role": "MEMBER"
}

== Anatomy of project
Here is a short description of the different classes.

=== Configuration

* link:src/main/kotlin/fr/gwa/seed/config/WebFluxConfig.kt[WebFluxConfigurer] : is the manifest of the entries points.

* link:src/main/kotlin/fr/gwa/seed/config/SecurityConfig.kt[SecurityConfig] : init firebase SDK and define security strategy of different entries points

=== Model and Database

* link:src/main/kotlin/fr/gwa/seed/model/Member.kt[Member] : my basic model.

* link:src/main/kotlin/fr/gwa/seed/db/MemberRepository.kt[MemberRepository] : very impressive, this interface is enough to access the database, the library does all the work.

=== Security

* link:src/main/kotlin/fr/gwa/seed/security/AuthenticationToken.kt[AuthenticationToken] : a wrapper around token object to add grant type information.

* link:src/main/kotlin/fr/gwa/seed/security/SecurityContextRepository.kt[SecurityContextRepository] : parsing of request header to extract bearer token.

* link:src/main/kotlin/fr/gwa/seed/security/AuthenticationManager.kt[AuthenticationManager] : processing authentication.

=== Services
A classic implementation of a service.

* link:src/main/kotlin/fr/gwa/seed/handlers/MemberHandler.kt[MemberHandler]

* link:src/main/kotlin/fr/gwa/seed/services/impl/MemberServiceImpl.kt[MemberService]

== What's next ?
From this beginning, it is possible to work on the following points:

* Managing multiple grant types (Facebook, twiter, ...)
* Make this base compatible with a micro-services architecture
* More services
